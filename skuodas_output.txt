Skuodas is a city located in Klaipėda County, in northwestern Lithuania, near the border with Latvia. It serves as the capital of the Skuodas District Municipality and is situated along the Bartuva River. The city has historical significance and was first mentioned in 1253. It gained city rights in 1572 under Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz and later evolved with construction like the parish church and municipal buildings.

During its history, Skuodas belonged to various prominent families, including the Chodkiewicz and Sapieha families. By the 19th century, it had a thriving Jewish community, though the town suffered gravely during World War II, particularly with the Holocaust.

Noteworthy landmarks include its Evangelical Lutheran Church built in 1821, a Catholic Church constructed in Romanesque Revival style in 1847, and historical sites like its railway line established in 1915 and square damaged and rebuilt post-WWII. Skuodas now has schools, museums, a post office, a cultural center, and healthcare facilities.

Famous residents include the historian Simonas Daukantas and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas. It's also twinned with Lindås, Norway.
