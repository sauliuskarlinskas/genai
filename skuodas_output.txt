The name "Skuodas" is derived from a surname, "Skuodas." Over time, this name became associated with the city. It has also been referred to in Polish as "Szkudy," and in German as "Schoden." Additionally, in the late 16th century, a new part of the city was briefly called "Johanisberg" or "Johanisburg," though these names did not gain enduring popularity.
